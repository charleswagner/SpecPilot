# SpecPilot Product Roadmap

## Product Vision
**"AI Speed. Engineered Discipline."**

SpecPilot bridges the critical prototype-to-production chasm by solving the paradox of modern AI coding assistants: AI makes it incredibly easy to write code, but dangerously hard to build viable, maintainable software.

## Problem Statement
The "vibe coding" trap where developers experience initial magical speed with AI assistants, but then fall into the prototype-to-production chasm with:
- Undocumented architectural decisions lost in chat history
- Brittle, untested code that's hard to understand  
- Time saved typing being dwarfed by debugging and reverse-engineering
- Wrestling with a "chaotic, unreliable apprentice" instead of guiding a partner
- Black box of undocumented choices when the "vibe" fades

## Target Audience
**Aspiring Solo Unicorns & Enterprise Super Coders**

T-shaped leaders, founders, or architects with:
- History of excellence in engineering, product, or leadership (Senior Engineer level+)
- Deep understanding of professional, enterprise-grade systems
- May be "code-rusty" and haven't been in the weeds recently
- Highly creative with strong architectural vision
- Frustrated by the chaos of "vibe coding"
- Need to learn effective AI orchestration to translate vision into high-quality code

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **SpecPilot Score Improvement**
   - Target: 80% of users achieve +20 point improvement within first 30 days
