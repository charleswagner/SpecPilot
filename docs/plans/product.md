# SpecPilot - Product Specification

## Product Vision
**"AI Speed. Engineered Discipline."**

SpecPilot bridges the critical prototype-to-production chasm by solving the paradox of modern AI coding assistants: AI makes it incredibly easy to write code, but dangerously hard to build viable, maintainable software.

## Problem Statement
The "vibe coding" trap where developers experience initial magical speed with AI assistants, but then fall into the prototype-to-production chasm with:
- Undocumented architectural decisions lost in chat history
- Brittle, untested code that's hard to understand  
- Time saved typing being dwarfed by debugging and reverse-engineering
- Wrestling with a "chaotic, unreliable apprentice" instead of guiding a partner
- Black box of undocumented choices when the "vibe" fades

## Target Audience
**Aspiring Solo Unicorns & Enterprise Super Coders**

T-shaped leaders, founders, or architects with:
- History of excellence in engineering, product, or leadership (Senior Engineer level+)
- Deep understanding of professional, enterprise-grade systems
- May be "code-rusty" and haven't been in the weeds recently
- Highly creative with strong architectural vision
- Frustrated by the chaos of "vibe coding"
- Need to learn effective AI orchestration to translate vision into high-quality code

## Competitive Analysis

### Key Differentiators
- **Spec-Driven Methodology** - Enforced documentation-first approach
- **Comprehensive Scoring System** - Objective measurement of AI orchestration effectiveness
- **Mode-Based Architecture** - Structured, protocol-driven development phases
- **Built-in Quality Gates** - Prevention rather than detection of technical debt

### Unique Value Proposition
SpecPilot is the only framework that transforms experienced architects into elite AI orchestrators by providing structured workflows that maintain engineering discipline while maximizing AI speed.

## Product Components

### 1. SpecPilot Framework (Primary Product)
The core AI-powered development methodology with 10 specialized modes.

### 2. SpecPilot Bootstrapper (Installation Tool)
A user-friendly command-line installer designed to set up new or existing projects with the SpecPilot framework.

## Strategic Analysis

### Risks & Assumptions

**Key Assumptions:**
- Senior developers are frustrated with "vibe coding" and willing to adopt structured methodologies
- AI coding assistants will continue to proliferate, making the problem more acute
- Experienced architects value engineering discipline over pure speed
- Documentation-first approaches can be made frictionless enough for adoption

**Major Risks:**
- **Adoption Risk**: Framework complexity may deter users seeking quick solutions
- **Market Timing Risk**: AI tooling evolution may make current approach obsolete
- **Behavior Change Risk**: Changing ingrained coding habits is notoriously difficult
- **Competition Risk**: Major IDE vendors may build similar functionality natively

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**
- **GitHub Copilot + Traditional Linting**: Lacks systematic workflow methodology
- **Cursor IDE**: Focuses on AI chat interface but lacks structured development protocols
- **Replit Agent**: Targets rapid prototyping, not production-grade development

**Indirect Competitors:**
- **Traditional Development Frameworks**: Django, Rails (structured but not AI-aware)
- **Code Quality Tools**: SonarQube, CodeClimate (quality focus but not AI-orchestration)

**Market Positioning:**
SpecPilot uniquely combines AI acceleration with engineering discipline - neither pure AI tools nor traditional frameworks address this specific gap.

## Bootstrapper Installation Component

### User Modes During Onboarding/Bootstrap/Install

### Interactive Mode (Default)

**Command:** `python3 bootstrap.py init`

**Purpose:** Full guided onboarding experience for new users or detailed project setup

**Behavior:**
- Initiates multi-phase interactive onboarding session
- Guides users through project identity configuration
- Collects development philosophy preferences
- Configures SpecPilot modes based on user selections
- Provides educational context throughout the process

### Fast Mode (Non-Interactive)

**Command:** `python3 bootstrap.py init --fast --title "/directory/"`

**Purpose:** Quick setup for experienced users or automated environments

**Behavior:**
- Bypasses interactive questions entirely
- Uses provided `--title` for project configuration
- Defaults to git config `user.name` for user identity
- Applies "Scalable MVP" / "Strict" / "Proactive Pilot" methodology defaults
- Automatically installs engine and boilerplate documentation

## Core Functionality

### Environment Setup

**Welcome Experience:**
- Display animated ASCII art introduction
- Set professional, engaging tone for the installation process

**Validation:**
- Analyze project state (new vs. existing)
- Abort gracefully with clear error messages when requirements aren't met

**File Management:**
- Create `.specpilot/engine` and `.specpilot/workspace/[username]` directories
- Install boilerplate `docs/` directory with template files
- Generate user-specific `.specpilot.local` configuration file
- Safely append `.specpilot.local` to `.gitignore` (with user permission in interactive mode)

### Error Handling

**Critical Scenarios:**
- Target directory is not a Git repository
- User chooses to abort installation mid-process
- Existing files would be overwritten in `docs/` directory

**Response Strategy:**
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Request explicit user confirmation for destructive operations
- Offer graceful exit options at key decision points
