# Specification: [Feature or Module Name]

> **Instruction to the Developer:** This is the template for a feature specification. A spec is the source of truth for a single, verifiable piece of functionality. Fill out each section before beginning implementation.

## 1. Objective
> **Instruction to the Developer:** A clear, concise goal for this specific module or script. What is the one thing it should do?

## 2. Functional Requirements

### Inputs
> **Instruction to the Developer:** What does the function/class take as input? Be specific about types, formats, and constraints.

### Outputs/Return Values
> **Instruction to the Developer:** What should it produce? Define the exact format and any side effects.

### Core Logic
> **Instruction to the Developer:** A step-by-step description of the process. This should be clear enough for the AI to write the code directly from these instructions.

### Error Handling
> **Instruction to the Developer:** How should failures be managed? What specific exceptions should be caught and raised?

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
> **Instruction to the Developer:** List any dependencies, performance constraints (e.g., "must respond in <100ms"), or security considerations.

## 4. Examples
> **Instruction to the Developer:** Provide a code snippet showing how to call the function and a sample of the input and expected output. This is crucial for both the AI and for writing tests.
