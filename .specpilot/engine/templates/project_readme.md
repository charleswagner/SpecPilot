## âœ¨ Spec-Driven Development
This project is built using the **SpecPilot framework**, which enforces a rigorous, spec-driven development methodology. All new functionality must begin as a detailed markdown **specification file** located in the `docs/specs/` directory.

This approach ensures every feature is well-defined, testable, and aligned with our goals before any code is written. The spec is the source of truth.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

> **Instruction to the Developer:** Add instructions on how to set up the development environment, install dependencies, and run the application for the first time.

```bash
# Example setup commands
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 src/main.py
```

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
This project follows a strict separation of concerns, orchestrated by the SpecPilot framework.
