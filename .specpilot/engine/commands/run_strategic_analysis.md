    1.  **Core Vision:** `README.md` and `docs/plans/product_roadmap.md`.
    2.  **Technical Foundation:** `docs/plans/architecture.md` and the entire `src/` codebase.
    3.  **Developer Intent:** All user notepad in `.specpilot/workspace/[username]/notepad/`.
    4.  **Developer Activity:** All user logs in `.specpilot/workspace/[username]/logs/`.
    5.  **External Context:** Conduct external research on the product's domain (e.g., human psychology for user-facing apps, systems architecture for dev tools).

**Step 2: Generate the Strategic Analysis Report**

    1.  **Executive Summary**
