**2024-01-15 - Pilot Mode** - Comprehensive SpecPilot Enhancement Plan

## Product Enhancement Tasks

### Add features to product.md
- All the main modes documentation
- All the commands reference
- All the flows mapping
- How to use the product guide
- Product interface and integration specifications

### Protocol Architecture Improvements
- Define separation of concerns for each protocol
- Separate validation for each protocol
- Figure out naming conflicts between protocols and main
- Read me generation (nice to have)
- Versioning strategy - How we will get there
- Multi notepad feature implementation
- Make .specpilot/engine non-editable enforcement

## Robustness & Validation Framework

### Product Robustness
- Validate against previous versions
- Make product validation robust
- Generate product documentation
- Complex reporting capabilities

### Product Roadmap Robustness
- Validate requirements systematically
- Generate requirements automatically
- Complex reporting features

### Architecture Robustness
- Validate architecture compliance
- Generate architecture documentation
- Complex architectural reports

### Technical Roadmap Enhancement
- Validate roadmap completeness
- Generate roadmap from architecture
- Complex roadmap reporting

### Specifications Robustness
- Make specs validation robust
- Enhanced spec generation
- Comprehensive spec reporting

## Project Structure & Conventions

### Project Conventions Enhancement
- Currently seems isolated - needs integration
- Directory structure standardization
- .spec file conventions establishment

## Mode Architecture Redesign

### Initialization vs Pilot Mode Separation
- **Initialization**: Goes through validation step by step, determines lifecycle position
- **Pilot Mode**: Focuses on development checking roadmaps
- **Deep Check**: Top-down to bottom-up comprehensive validation
- **Session Check**: Recently changed files validation (top-down and bottom-up)

### Validation Integration
- Conventions must be loaded at every step
- Architecture should be validated consistently

## Template & File Generation

### Default File Generation
- Generate default files with all required sections
- Update template defaults for each file type
- Ensure project conventions are checked at every step
- Create default templates repository

## Quality Assurance Features

### Enhanced Deep Check
- For each file: validate alignment with spec, architecture, etc.
- Update session check capabilities

### Framework Protection
- Feature to prevent edits in .specpilot/engine directory

## Release & Distribution

### Bootstrapping Completion
- Finish bootstrapping feature and installation process
- Package into downloadable format
- Verify on personal project testing
- Create marketing materials
- Generate comprehensive README

### Testing Strategy
- Break each step into testable components
- Comprehensive test coverage

**2024-01-15 - Pilot Mode** - Product Validation Enhancement Process

## Advanced Validation Logic for Product Mode

### Codebase Analysis Workflow
- Read every file of the codebase starting with the src directory, then docs, etc.
- Conceptualize what the developer is trying to do

### 3F Classification System  
- Categorize all major Features, Frameworks and Flow Analysis
- Read the docs/plans/product.md file and validate that all major features, Frameworks, and Flows are documented in the 3F section in some way
